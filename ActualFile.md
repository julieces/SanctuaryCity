Egypt is one of the top five countries with the largest number of urban refugees, and one of two African countries that don’t require that refugees live within camps. Cairo is currently hosting large numbers of refugees from Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Palestine and elsewhere. In Cairo, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the primary institution that determines refugees’ status and offers protection. While NGOs and the UNHCR attempt to do their best to accommodate refugee populations in Cairo, these refugees still face issues in terms of legal representation/protection, security, employment, education, and healthcare—all of which are issues already faced by native Egyptians. For many refugees, despite speaking Arabic, Egypt is merely a pitstop on the way to Europe. Refugee organizations in Egypt, including UNHCR-Egypt, have attempted to create programs that address these integration issues, but have inadvertently deepened the divide between refugees and Egyptians by creating separate systems of care.

Founded by St.Andrew’s United Church of Cairo, stARS attempts to establish an inclusive space for displaced individuals from: Ethiopia, Eritrea, Iraq, South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. In terms of education, stARS provides a preschool for children ages 3-6, an English-Sudanese curriculum for adolescents, an adult education program, and work training programs in fields like hairstyling, henna, sewing, IT work, and English. The organization also offers psychosocial services, assigning therapists/psychiatrists to certain clients to assess their mental and emotional status and provide resources “to help them think of ways to solve their problems.” The Refugee Legal Aid Program (RLAP) provides information, counseling, referral, representation, and advocacy for asylum seekers and refugees in Egypt. RLAP works with UNHCR and resettlement countries to assess refugee status determination, protection, and resettlement. With resettlement being an impossible prospect for many refugees, and repatriation being far too dangerous, most refugees find themselves remaining in a country they have difficulty integrating into.

Despite their efforts at resettlement, only refugees who are at risk in Egypt for one of the reasons that the UNHCR designates are able to be resettled:

• Medical Needs (life-threatening condition or severe dis-
ability; requires treatment unavailable in Egypt; high prognosis of success if treated elsewhere; not able to over disability in Egypt; condition worsened in Egypt)
• Women at Risk
• Survivors of Violence and Torture (with severe effects
of that torture in Egypt)
• Unaccompanied Minors
• Family Reunification
• Elderly Refugees

Most of these refugees are referred to live in the U.S., though the U.S. has its own resettlement programs for specific populations, rendering the resettlement efforts of RLAP futile.

When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.” Leviticus 19:33-34

Despite the Christian population in Egypt being 10%, Refuge Egypt is another Christian organization providing humanitarian support to refugees in Cairo. For the first 2 years of being in Egypt, refugees are provided with food, clothing, and shelter. The organization provides youth education and mentorship, and trains refugee adults while placing them with prospective-employers in the fields of cooking, cleaning, driving, and babysitting. This organization also provides medical services through primary health care services, for other services, the organization provides referrals.  Unfortunately, 42 million native citizens already do not have insurance in Egypt, meaning that it is unlikely that refugees can receive medical care outside of facilities that cater solely to refugees.

The UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) has four offices in Egypt, three of which are located in Cairo. UNHCR seeks one of three durable solutions for refugees and asylum-seekers. These include voluntarily repatriation to the country of origin, local integration in the country of asylum, or resettlement to a third country. UNHCR works closer with NGOs in Egypt than it does with the Egyptian government itself, which can make local integration difficult. The UNHCR also “seeks to reduce situations of forced displacement by encouraging States and other institutions to create conditions that are conducive to the protection of human rights and the peaceful resolution of disputes. Ironically, the UNHCR has done little to protect the minority Christian population in Egypt, who are themselves seeking asylum elsewhere because of extreme religious persecution. It is possible that the vulnerability of Christians in Egypt is the driving force behind their desire to help refugees who, despite their different backgrounds and religions, have experienced similar persecution and violence. Though most NGOs that UNHCR is affiliated with are church-based, volunteers are extremely diverse in order to match the diversity of the country’s refugees and asylum-seekers.

The EFRR (Egyptian Foundation for Refugee Rights) is an organization that employs and trains a national network of lawyers that provide legal services to refugees in Egypt. According to their website, “The network allows an increased number of refugees to access legal services in Cairo and provides, for the first time, legal services to refugees outside of Cairo.” The organization focuses on the representation of refugees that have been arrested, detained, or on the verge of deportation. The EFRR also hosts community meetings with refugees every several months, where members of the refugee communities are educated about laws that protect them and their rights. These meetings also function as networking events, where members of marginalized refugee communities can come together. Nevertheless, violence against refugees still persists in Egypt, as employment and educational facilities are already limited.

**Why Germany?** 

The right to asylum is a constitutional right in Germany and granted to everyone who flees political persecution. 

Yet, there are adjustments made due to the current refugee crisis.

Despite these adjustments, there are many organizations in Berlin that help refugees integrating into the German society as well as getting jobs and proper education.

**General Rules and Norms for Admission of Refugees and Handling Refugee Claims**

If the applicant was the victim of political persecution, he or she may be granted political asylum under article 16a of the Basic Law. 

**Processes for Handling Refugees**

A refugee can either register as an asylum-seeker at the border or inside the country. The authorities then direct him or her to the closest reception facility. 

**Adjustments or Amendments to the Refugee Handling Procedure Due to the Current Refugee Crisis**

Several amendments to current laws have been adopted in recent months due to the refugee crisis.  

On August 1, 2015, the Act to Redefine the Right to Stay and the Termination of Residence entered into force. It amended the Residence Act by ordering a ban on entry and residence for applicants from safe countries of residence and in case of repeat follow-up applications.

On October 24, 2015, the Act on the Acceleration of Asylum Procedures entered into force. The Act amended several laws in order to accelerate the asylum process.

On November 1, 2015, the Act to Improve Housing, Care, and Treatment of Foreign Minors and Adolescents entered into force. Its goal is to improve the situation of young unaccompanied refugees and provide them with appropriate care.

On February 3, 2016, the German government agreed on a set of stricter asylum measures (Asylum Package II), which will now be debated by the German Bundestag. The Asylum Package II would suspend family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for a period of two years; decrease asylees’ monthly cash benefits; facilitate deportation; establish a new Federal Police unit to help procure replacement documents; improve the safety of refugee minors; and designate Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia as safe countries of origin.

Known as Kiron University, it is an educational institution in Berlin that enables refugees'access to higher education and successful learning through digital solutions. Opened in 2015, the unversity runs all of its courses online and students have to submit proof of their refugee status in order to enroll. The university puts courses online by existing universities such as Yale, Harvard, and Cambridge, providing a wide range of courses availabe for refugees.

Migration Hub is a network of social entrepreneurs and organisations working in the field of migration, refugee support and assimilation for people who are fleeing for their lives from the Middle East and Africa. Its aim is to create an environment where refugee aid organisations can congregate and collaborate with one another to figure out ways to improve the lives of refugees in Berlin. This co-working collective is located on Spreewerkstätten, and the landlord who owns the building offered the office space rent-free. The ultimate goal at Migration Hub is to mentor refugees, connecting them with organisations working in the sector and encouraging collaboration, knowledge exchange and best practice sharing across the world.

CUCULA takes in refugees as trainees and teaches them craft and design skills, which they can use to find work upon completing the program. Additionally, CUCULA is set up to aid the refugees during their visa application processes and to provide them housing in the interim. The project is funded through the profits yielded from selling the contemporary furniture that the refugees themselves create at the company.

The Pergamon Museum contains one of the largest collections of Islamic art originating from places like present-day Syria and Iraq. It would be pretty difficult to ignore the fact that thousands flock to the museum to enjoy these exquisite items while the countries themselves are being destroyed. Thus, the Pergamon is offering refugees the exclusive chance to become tour guides at the museum as a means of fostering richer cultural interchange. The tours are also offered to other refugees in their native languages thanks to the tour guides.

Refugees on Rails is an initiative that teaches the newcomers how to code. In doing so, the team at Refugees on Rails is helping to boost the economies throughout Europe while also giving refugees tools to better integrate into society. The project largely relies on the help of other IT professionals serving as volunteer buddies for the refugees enrolled in the program, along with donated laptops and other materials. The company has expanded to several cities around Germany since it first began in Berlin.

Once asylum seekers have been preregistered in Germany, they are sent to reception centres, often former army barracks with several hundred beds. They stay in these centerss for up to six months or until their application is decided on. After the application process, they are generally sent to group housing or are allocated private apartments. About 60 per cent of Germany’s refugees are living in reception centers or collective accommodation at the end of 2015 (the latest data available). 

Life in Germany remains a struggle for many of the recent arrivals after moving out of the reception centers. More than 1 million asylum-seekers reached the country in 2015 and at times more than 10,000 people were arriving daily. However, only around 16 percent of refugees are employed, according to official data published in September of 2015.

While refugees are not getting much help in finding job opportunities from the government, the organizations mentioned are attempting to fill in the gaps for them to integrate into the German society. Most of the organizations that provide help for refugees in Berlin are either educational, resourceful, or constructive. They not only teach refugees new skills that can contribute to the development of Germany but also allowing them to have the agency to feel that they are valuable to the German society.

#**What's next?**
Our hope is that as resources for displaced peoples continue to grow, so will this map. As more cities and destinations are added, perhaps the definition of what it means to be a "Sanctuary City" will become expanded and clarified, making it a genuine tool for more inclusive policies and community-building.
